# Heist to the Museum Distribution Simulation
### Heist to the Museum
This is a simulation consisting in a group of thieves controlled by a master thief to steal paintings in several rooms from a Museum. More specifications can be found on "SD - Problem_Description.pdf".
### Requirements
The target of the simualation was Java 8.
### Project context
This simulation problem is part of a curricular unit at Universidade de Aveiro, original ideia from Pedro Mariano. There are three branches representing 3 solutions:
- Using java's explicit monitors, running all entities in one computer;
- Modifying the first approach to distribute the simulation; each entity runs in a different computer, simulating how Java's RMI works;
- Finally, the simulation uses the Java RMI solution, with a minor change to work on "free" RMI.
